This story starts like most others in a room with someone waking, the person we are talking about is not special in any way that we know of yet but will prove to be of great importance.
Our main character’s name is Gareth, Gareth is from London the has been studding to be a mechanic for a couple of years now and is happy with his girlfriend Lisa then live in a top floor apartment in Fulham, and have been together for a couple of years. Lisa is also a easy to walk past person because she doesn’t have the outward appurtenance of someone who could change your day as greatly as she can, while Lisa is a relaxed person out of work is a very diligent nurse during her work hours and that’s where Gareth and Lisa meet, Gareth cut himself at work one day and needed a couple of stiches and a tetanus booster, luckily for Gareth it was a slow day in A&E so he had plenty of time to talk with Lisa.
If we Skip forward a couple of years back to the present Lisa and Gareth are now going out and living comfortable in the apartment, but that’s not the reason we are reading this story.
