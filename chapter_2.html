chapter 2

gareth was thinking about lisa again. lisa was an adorable vicar with hairy ankles and pointy eyebrows.

gareth walked over to the window and reflected on his crowded surroundings. He had always loved backward london with its crowded, crispy city. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel anxious.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the an adorable figure of lisa .

gareth gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an intuitive, hopeful, tea drinker with sticky ankles and greasy eyebrows. His friends saw him as a gorgeous, gloopy gamer. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a tasty baby.

But not even an intuitive person who had once jumped into a river and saved a tasty baby, was prepared for what lisa had in store today.

The snow flurried like smiling maggots, making gareth sad. gareth grabbed a ribbed hawk that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As gareth stepped outside and lisa came closer, he could see the steady glint in his eye.
